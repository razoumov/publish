# "Unleash Linux on MacOS" DHSI mini-workshop

* These notes at http://bit.ly/2l1il0H.

Abstract: Do you have a Mac? Did you know that BSD Unix is what powers much of OSX? Did you know that
despite this heritage you don't have access to many Linux tools and resources because they are locked out
by Apple?  Would you like to unlock the full power of a Linux system and take control of your computing
destiny? In this workshop you'll walk in with a regular OSX laptop and walk out with a software
application called "Homebrew" installed that will give you the ability to install and run a wide variety
of Linux programs and tools, allowing you to enjoy the full benefits of the free and open source software
community that has made Linux the premiere scientific computing platform.

## Introduction

MacOS is a built on top of Darwin (Apple's open-source Unix OS) which itself is a derivative of various
implementations of BSD, a Unix OS from Berkeley, developed in the 1970s-80s. Being a UNIX-like OS, MacOS
is similar to Linux, but they have different kernel source code (core of the OS).

Linux comes with thousands of open-source tools and applications, and the vast majority of these can also
be compiled from source code on MacOS, as the underlying OSs share the same principles and have very
similar architecture. MacOS includes some fraction of these tools, but many are missing. To install the
ones that are missing, you can download their source code and compile them. In practice, this is tedious
and may involve many manual steps, as often you will have to compile their dependencies by hand and make
sure you have the right versions.

Using a package manager automates these tasks. Homebrew (https://brew.sh) is a package manager for MacOS:

* gives a central catalogue of available packages
* formula = a package definition written in Ruby
* provides simple commands for working with all packages: **list**, **search**, **info**, **install**,
  **update**, **uninstall**
* automatically tracks and installs missing dependencies for each package
* compiles (builds) each package/dependency from source code if a pre-compiled version is not available
* installs formulae into their own Cellar (keg) directory
* symlinks their files into /usr/local
* written in git and ruby (formulae are simple Ruby scripts)
* everything is brew themed

## Installing Homebrew

~~~ {.bash}
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
~~~

You might need to download Command Line Tools from Apple. Likely need to install Xcode, and then install
command-line tools:

~~~ {.bash}
xcode-select --install
~~~

It is a good idea to do this early on:

~~~ {.bash}
sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local
~~~

Once in a while run:

~~~ {.bash}
brew doctor      # self-diagnose, will output a lot of details
brew update      # download new formulae (where to find software, lists of dependencies, how to install)
~~~

If you ever want to uninstall Homebrew:

~~~ {.bash}
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/uninstall)"
~~~

## Working with packages

~~~ {.bash}
brew search              # search for all packages
for i in echo $(brew search); do echo $i; done | wc -l    # shows 4707 lines
brew search imagemagick
brew info imagemagick
brew install imagemagick
brew list
brew upgrade imagemagick
brew upgrade      # all installed packages
~~~

If you ever want to remove this package:

~~~ {.bash}
brew uninstall imagemagick
~~~

## Getting help

~~~ {.bash}
brew help
brew help <command>
~~~

## Taps

If you cannot find a package in the main Homebrew repository, you can also tap other repositories:

~~~ {.bash}
brew tap user/repo     # shallow-clone https://github.com/user/repo to your laptop (make all its formulae available)
brew tap brewsci/bio
ls /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/brewsci/homebrew-bio/Formula/    # list packages in this repository
brew tap     # list all installed taps (cloned repositories) on your laptop
brew untap user/repo   # remove the taps (brew will no longer be aware of their formulae)
~~~

## Fine-level controls

~~~ {.bash}
brew pin <formula>    # stop something from being updated/upgraded
brew unpin <formula>   # allow that formulae to update again
brew reinstall <formula> --build-from-source     # force compiling from source
~~~

## Mac OS GUI apps

~~~ {.bash}
brew install cask
brew cask help
brew cask list    # list all installed packages
brew cask search     # list all available cask packages
brew cask search firefox
brew cask info firefox
brew cask install firefox
brew cask install google-chrome
brew cask install iterm2   # better replacement for Terminal
brew cask install iina     # "modern" video player for macOS
brew cask install vlc      # VLC media player
brew cask install xquartz    # Apple X-server
brew cask install bitwarden   # multi-platform password manager (GUI + command line + mobile, completely free)
~~~
