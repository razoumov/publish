## Requirements

- ideally a Python library, to tie to data manipulation in Python
- must be presented interactively in a web browser
- must have a zoomable/scrollable 2D heatmap of a continuous variable such air quality, pressure,
  etc. plotted over a recognizable geographic map
  - ideally the heatmap would be encoded in the tiles at any resolution level similar to
    https://maps.darksky.net
  - would be nice to be able to switch between different fields/variables
- must show individual weather stations, and a mouse-over should open more data from that station

## Tools

### Basemap Matplotlib toolkit

- [extension to matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/basemap/users/examples.html): not interactive, creates
  a static PNG
- this is what they already use -- see FireWork_ModelPerfAtStn.png
- results can be [really nice](https://python-graph-gallery.com/315-a-world-map-of-surf-tweets)

### GeoViews library

- [Python library](http://geo.holoviews.org) for plotting weather, climate, remote sensing datasets on
  top of maps
- uses either matplotlib (for static plots) or bokeh (for interactive maps) backend
- still very much static

### Follium

- [Folium Python library](https://folium.readthedocs.io/en/latest) visualizes data on an interactive Leaflet.js map
- docs: [Folium Quickstart Guide](https://folium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html),
  [official documentation](https://folium.readthedocs.io/en/latest),
  [useful script examples](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium/tree/master/examples),
  install with *pip install folium*
- what they call [*heatmaps*](http://qingkaikong.blogspot.com/2016/06/using-folium-3-heatmap.html) do
  not show a continuous distribution but rather frequency/location of discrete events or map locations
  that blend into a
  [frequency heatmap](https://cdn.rawgit.com/razoumov/publish/058067cd/maps/foliumHeatMap.html) (with
  foliumHeatMap.py) when you zoom out (think earthquakes, bus stops, schools, etc)
- workarounds:
  1. can use [a mesh of markers](https://cdn.rawgit.com/razoumov/publish/60563ccd/maps/foliumCircles.html)
    (with foliumCircles.py)
  1. can use GeoJSON and TopoJSON layers on top of a geographical map (more of a hack for heatmaps)

### Plot.ly

- docs: [tutorials](https://plot.ly/python), [examples](https://plot.ly/create),
  [keyword index](https://plot.ly/python/reference),
  [getting started guide](https://plot.ly/python/getting-started),
  [community feed with gallery](https://plot.ly/feed)
- free, open-source, does not require an online plot.ly account
- data-driven plots; provides *scattergeo* data-type tag
- for online plotting [need to generate your API key](https://plot.ly/settings/api)
- really great with
  [markers on geographical maps](https://cdn.rawgit.com/razoumov/publish/845eaae6/maps/citiesByPopulation.html)
  (with citiesByPopulation.py)
- plot.ly does not support *heatmaps* or *filled contours* or even *shapes* on top of maps
- as a workaround, one could show geo-spatial distribution on top of maps with:
  1. choropleths over custom areas (really a hack, fairly difficult to do)
  1. scatter plots, e.g.,
     [markers on a regular grid](https://cdn.rawgit.com/razoumov/publish/cedeb718/maps/geoMesh.html)
     (with geoMesh.py) or
     [even combining markers with choropleth maps](https://cdn.rawgit.com/razoumov/publish/21b20d58/maps/combine.html)
     (with combine.py), but cannot combine with heatmaps (one will overwrite the other)
  1. lines showing contours (need to be computed separately), but NOT filled contours

### Bokeh

- what they call *interactive maps* is just a non-rectangular heatmap (with zoom/pan), no underlying
  zoomable geographical map; e.g., see the bottom image in http://bit.ly/2G1PzZT
- can [import coast/other lines](http://geo.holoviews.org/Gridded_Datasets_II.html) into regular heat map
  images, but these are not multi-resolution geographical maps
